            “The agricultural sector in Zimbabwe contributes about 21% towards
            the country’s GDP. Out of this, more than 50% comes from smallholder
            and medium-scale farmers yet they are still relying on traditional
            methods of farming that are so outdated, imprecise, and
            labor-intensive. Clearly, smallholder and medium-scale farmers are
            under-represented as they have the potential to contribute so much
            to the country’s economy. As someone who grew up in a farming
            community, I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of my family and
            neighbors, losing crops to unpredictable weather, pest attacks, and
            the sheer exhaustion of manual labor. I have watched hard-working
            farmers struggle to make a living, not because they lack knowledge
            or effort, but because they lack access to modern tools and
            technologies that could revolutionize their productivity. Smart
            Farms was born out of my desire to change this narrative. By
            integrating drone technology into agriculture, we are creating a
            future where farmers can monitor crops, apply inputs with precision,
            and make data-driven decisions—all with minimal effort and maximum
            impact. Our mission is to empower these farmers, increase food
            security, and promote sustainable farming practices. I believe that
            with the right support and innovation, smallholder farmers will no
            longer be left behind. They will become the backbone of a
            technologically empowered and thriving agricultural economy.”
